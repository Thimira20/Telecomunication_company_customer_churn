# Customer Churn Prediction Model

## Project Overview
This project develops a machine learning model to predict whether a customer will leave or stay with the company. It uses logistic regression for classification.

## Dataset
- The dataset contains customer information, including demographics, account details, and usage patterns.
- The target variable is whether the customer churned (1) or remained (0).

## Model Used
- **Logistic Regression**: A statistical method for binary classification.

## Evaluation Metrics
### Logistic Regression Results:
- **Accuracy**: 79%
- **F1-Score (Class 0 vs 1)**:
  - **Class 0 (Non-Churn)**: High precision and recall (~0.86 F1-score).
  - **Class 1 (Churn)**: Lower precision and recall, leading to an F1-score of 0.57.
